    <div class="question">
        How do I know if I need mental health support?

    <div class="answer">
        <p>If you're experiencing symptoms such as persistent feelings of sadness, anxiety, excessive 
            stress, difficulty focusing, changes in sleep or appetite, or if you're feeling disconnected from
             others, it might be a sign that you could benefit from support. It's okay to seek help if you're
              feeling overwhelmed or need guidance. Our platform is here for you.
